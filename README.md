# README.txt

This simulation reproduces the model published in:

Cataldo E, Byrne JH, Baxter DA
Computational Model of a Central Pattern Generator
*Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics* (2006, in press)

## Example use:

- Start SNNAP (double click on the SNNAP.jar file)
- Click on "Run Simulation"
- Then in the new window, select "File" → "Load Simulation"
- Browse to and load **rBMP.smu** file to load a simulation that creates a figure similar to Fig.5 from the paper and click "Start"
- See [http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu/](http://snnap.uth.tmc.edu/) to download SNNAP
